# CAS Garbage Collection & Reachability (Report-Only)

Tideforge Content-Addressed Storage (CAS) stores package build artifacts as
immutable blobs indexed by ActionResults and repository metadata. Over time,
superseded build waves, unreferenced candidate packages, and test artifacts
accumulate in storage.

The subsystem for garbage collection (#430 step 5, #485) measures
reachability. It applies an age grace period and records tombstones without
deletion of live objects.

## Storage Contract

Production CAS paths in R2:

```text
actions/sha256/<action-key>.json     -- Authoritative ActionResult manifests
blobs/sha256/<artifact-digest>       -- Immutable content blobs
```

Protected `main` publishers write blobs first and the ActionResult last.

## Mark Phase

The check for reachability reads two categories of retained roots:

1. **Retained ActionResults**: All active ActionResult manifests under
   `actions/sha256/*.json`. Each artifact entry (`name`, `size`, `digest`)
   marks its content blob as reachable.
2. **Current Repository Metadata**: All package entries in served indexes
   declared by `manifests/package-factory.yaml` (`published_index` for RPM,
   DEB, and Arch). The engine marks any blob that matches a served package digest or path
   as reachable.

The union of these two sets forms the complete **reachable blob set**.

## Sweep Phase (Report-Only)

The engine classifies any CAS blob not in the reachable set as **unreachable**.

### Age Grace Period

To protect in-flight builds (where runners upload blobs before
manifest publication) and recent build waves:

- Default grace period: **7 days** (604,800 seconds).
- Configurable via `--grace-period-days` or `--grace-period-seconds`.
- The report classifies blobs younger than the grace period as `grace` (protected).
- The report classifies blobs older than or equal to the grace period as `candidate`
  (eligible for tombstones).

### Last-Referencing ActionResult Attribution

When historical ActionResults are available, the report links unreachable
blobs to the last ActionResult that references them. This explains why workers
created the blob (such as a superseded wave of `glib2-2.87.3-1.el10.x86_64.rpm`).
The report flags blobs that lack an ActionResult as orphans.

### Tombstone Manifest Format

Eligible sweep candidates past the grace period receive a formal tombstone
record (Schema 1):

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "tombstone": {
    "digest": "sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    "size": 1048576,
    "path": "blobs/sha256/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    "created_at": "2026-08-20T10:00:00+00:00",
    "unreachable_since": "2026-08-22T00:00:00+00:00",
    "tombstone_time": "2026-08-30T00:00:00+00:00",
    "grace_period_seconds": 604800,
    "last_referencing_action": "sha256:deadbeef...",
    "last_referencing_artifact": "glib2-2.87.3-1.el10.x86_64.rpm",
    "last_referencing_time": "2026-08-20T10:05:00+00:00",
    "reason": "unreachable_past_grace_period"
  }
}
```

## Running the GC Report

Run the reachability check locally or against storage listings:

```bash
# Scan a local CAS directory
python3 scripts/cas_gc.py --cas-dir /path/to/cas --grace-period-days 7 --summary

# Generate JSON and Markdown reports from an inventory listing
python3 scripts/cas_gc.py --inventory-lsf inventory.txt \
  --json cas-gc-report.json \
  --markdown cas-gc-report.md \
  --tombstones-dir tombstones/
```

## Safety Policy

1. **Strictly Report-Only**: No delete operations exist in `scripts/cas_gc.py`.
2. **Destructive Sweep Gating**: We defer destructive deletion to a future
   phase after reachability reports run clean across production waves.
