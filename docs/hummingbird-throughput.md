# Where Hummingbird desktop build time actually goes

Measured from the GitHub Actions logs of five real `Build Hummingbird desktops`
runs, 2026-07-25 to 2026-08-08.  Per-package numbers come from mock's own
`INFO: Done(...) Config(hummingbird-ci) N minutes M seconds` / `ERROR:
Exception(...)` lines; wall clock comes from the log timestamps of `==> Build
chain starting` to `==> ===== Summary`.

Method note: `build-chain.sh` runs each package in a background subshell whose
stdout is a pipe, so a worker's whole block of output carries the timestamp of
when the worker *exited*.  Per-package durations therefore have to be read off
mock's own timers, not off the surrounding log timestamps.

194 distinct packages, 6.80 hours of mock time.
min 42 s, p10 52 s, median 77.5 s, mean 126 s, p90 186 s, max 2686 s.

## Finding 1 — the job runs at concurrency 1.0, not 2

Σ mock is 95.6%–97.8% of the build step's entire wall clock, in every run, with
`--jobs 2`.  Two workers cannot both be inside mock 97% of the time; one can.
The `flock /local-repo/repo.lock` around `mock --rebuild` in
`build_package_podman` is **exclusive**, so `--jobs` selects how many workers
wait.  This is exactly what #266 diagnosed from the source; these are the
numbers that confirm it from the outside.

Nothing else in the build step is worth optimising until that lock is a
reader/writer split: at concurrency 1, every scheduling improvement upstream of
it is invisible.

## Finding 2 — 34% of mock time is rebuilding the same buildroot, 194 times

`Start: creating root cache` appears once per package across all five runs.
`unpacking root cache` appears **zero** times.  `/var/cache/mock` is not
mounted (`MOCK_CACHE_DIR` was unset for this workflow), so it lives inside the
per-package `podman run --rm` container and is discarded with it.  Every
package therefore pays `installing minimal buildroot with dnf5` in full, and
then pays again to tar a root cache nothing will ever read.

The shortest mock invocation observed anywhere in the corpus is **42 s**
(`python-aiohappyeyeballs`, which did chroot init and then failed at
`%pyproject_buildrequires`); the shortest *successful* one is **46 s**
(`vpnc-script`, whose `%install` copies a single shell script).  The eight
`niri-00` packages that failed at `%pyproject_buildrequires` — i.e. that did
chroot init, then stopped — ran 42–52 s.

Taking 43 s as the floor: it is paid 194 times, **2.32 h of the 6.80 h,
34.1%.**  It is a floor, not an average, so this is the conservative end.

Mock is built to avoid this and `--uniqueext` does not defeat it.  From
`mockbuild/buildroot.py`:

```python
self.shared_root_name = config['root']
if 'unique-ext' in config:
    config['root'] = "%s-%s" % (config['root'], config['unique-ext'])
...
self.cachedir = os.path.join(self.cache_topdir, self.shared_root_name)
```

The cache is keyed on the name from *before* uniqueext is appended, so
per-package chroots share one cache by design, with an fcntl lock (shared to
unpack, exclusive to rebuild) in `plugins/root_cache.py`.  On a hit,
`_init()` recomputes `chroot_was_initialized` after the preinit hooks, finds
the chroot populated, and skips `_init_pkg_management()` — and
`_rebuild_root_cache()` then declines to re-tar it.

It is safe against the local repo changing mid-run, which it does after every
tier: the root cache holds only the *minimal* buildroot, `BuildRequires` are
resolved after the unpack against the live repos, and mock's
`templates/fedora-rawhide.tpl` — which `mock/hummingbird-ci.cfg` includes —
sets `metadata_expire=0` in `[main]`, so cached metadata is revalidated on
every transaction.

## Finding 3 — there is a long pole, but it is 11%, not 93%

The largest single package in the corpus is `highway` at **44.8 m**, then
`abseil-cpp` at 30.0 m.  `highway` is 16% of gnome-00's mock time in the run it
appeared in, 11% of the tier's wall clock.

That matters for how much parallelism is worth buying, not for whether to buy
any.  For gnome-00 (Σ 16921 s, max 2707 s) the wall clock with W workers is
`max(Σ/W, max_pkg)`:

| W | 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gnome-00 wall | 282 m | 141 m | 70 m | 47 m | 45 m | 45 m |

The long pole binds from W≈7. Below that the packing is essentially perfect —
**at W=4 the tier barrier wastes no measurable time at all** (4 × 4230 s =
16920 s against Σ 16921 s).

## What that means for issue #267's three items

1. **Tier barriers.**  Real, but worth nothing yet.  At the 4 vCPU the job runs
   on, a tier's idle tail is ~0; a DAG wavefront only starts paying above ~6
   concurrent builds per tier, which requires both #266 and more cores.
2. **One runner per dispatch.**  This is the live ceiling.  680 packages at the
   measured 126 s mean is **~23.8 h of serialised mock**, and it is being asked
   of one runner out of the org's 60.  `desktop: all` cannot ever complete:
   gnome-00 alone was 288 m against a 360 m job cap.
3. **Runner size.**  Not actionable.  Blacksmith runners were removed org-wide
   on 2026-08-08 and every `runs-on:` in this repository is now `ubuntu-latest`
   or `ubuntu-24.04-arm`; no larger GitHub-hosted label is in use anywhere here
   and there is nothing to verify an entitlement against.  Note also that four
   concurrent mock builds on 4 vCPU share those 4 cores with `%{_smp_mflags}`,
   so for the compile-bound tail (`highway`, `abseil-cpp`) in-job concurrency
   repacks the cores rather than multiplying them — only more machines do that.

## Runner budget

One job per desktop is **5 concurrent runners** for the `desktop: all` path,
plus one short-lived `plan` job.  That is 8% of the org's 60, and it displaces
nothing that runs on a cron: this workflow is `workflow_dispatch` only.

The bootstrap tiers (10 packages, ~10 m) are rebuilt by each desktop job rather
than being built once and handed over.  That is 40 runner-minutes of duplicate
work, entirely off the critical path, against the alternative of a cross-job
dependency plus an artifact round-trip.  Sharding *within* a tier was rejected
for the same reason at a larger scale: each additional job pays the fixed
per-job cost measured at **184 s** (setup + checkout + apt + podman pull + R2
seed, run 31242725235, 05:54:29→05:57:33), so one job per package for all 680
would spend ~35 runner-hours on setup to parallelise ~24 runner-hours of work.

## Canary A/B, and the flag that made the first attempt worthless

Tier `niri-00`, 24 packages, `force: true`, `publish: false`, same runner
class, both after #266 landed (so `--jobs $(nproc)` = 4):

| run | branch | build-chain wall | Σ mock | `creating root cache` | `unpacking root cache` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [31265993115](https://github.com/tuna-os/tunaos-packages/actions/runs/31265993115) | `main` | **39.02 m** | 74.2 m | 24 | 0 |
| [31268488082](https://github.com/tuna-os/tunaos-packages/actions/runs/31268488082) | + `MOCK_CACHE_DIR` | **39.49 m** | — | 24 | 0 |

**No improvement.**  The mount was correct — the log shows mock writing
`/var/cache/mock/hummingbird-ci/root_cache/cache.tar.gz` with return code 0,
on the shared path with no uniqueext in it, exactly as
`buildroot.py`'s `shared_root_name` predicts.  What it also shows, 18 times:

```
INFO: /tmp/mock-configdir/hummingbird-ci.cfg newer than root cache; cache will be rebuilt
```

`_unpack_root_cache` unlinks the tarball when any file in `config_paths` is
newer than it.  `build-chain.sh` assembles the configdir inside every
package's container with

```sh
cp -a /etc/mock/. /tmp/mock-configdir/
cp    /repo-mock/*.cfg /tmp/mock-configdir/
```

and the second `cp` has no `-p`, so `hummingbird-ci.cfg` is stamped with the
current time microseconds before mock starts — always newer than a cache any
earlier package wrote.  Every package deleted the cache, rebuilt the
buildroot, re-tarred it, and threw it away.

With `-p` the profile keeps its checkout mtime, which precedes every cache
the run writes.  That is the whole fix, and nothing in the run reports its
absence: an invalidated root cache is merely slow.

Concurrency, for the record, is now 74.2 m of mock over 39.02 m of wall =
**1.90**, not the 4 that `--jobs $(nproc)` asks for, and per-package mock
time roughly doubled (median 77.5 s at jobs=2-but-serialised, 138.5 s at
jobs=4) because four builds share four cores with `%{_smp_mflags}`.  That is
the ceiling more machines address and in-job concurrency does not.
